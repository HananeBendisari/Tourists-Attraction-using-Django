I have built an application that allows for users to see a list of tourist attractions in each state: 

- Users can also specify the state that they want to see more detailed attractions with as well. 

- I created the templates for this website using Django!

Skills used: 
  - extending off of base templates, 
  - adding static files, 
  - and adding filters to variables being used within the template!
